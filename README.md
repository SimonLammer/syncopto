It is designed to help you in a matter, that most sync-clients lack - selecting which files to sync!

How does it work?
Say you want to sync a folder (will be referred to it as folder A), not all files it contains tho. You only want text-documents to sync. That is where Syncopto comes in handy! You simply link A to a new directory (folder B) - using Syncopto - and tell your cloud's sync client to sync B. Syncopto will then create links (You can imagine a link to be like a duplicate of a file, which needs no storage on your disk) for all the files you want in B.
End result: You have lots of files in A, only text-documents (other filters can be specified) get synced to the cloud.
